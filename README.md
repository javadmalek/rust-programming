## Tools
- [Manul](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html#the-rust-programming-language)
- [Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)

## Commands

- build a project using `cargo build`.
- build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
- build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the `target/debug` directory.
- Complie andrelease `cargo build --release`, Cargo stores it in the `target/release` directory.
